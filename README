# dionsthesis
A custom LaTeX2e documentclass for typesetting beautiful, modern theses.

Apart from [the actual documentclass `dionsthesis`](https://github.com/dionhaefner/dionsthesis/blob/master/dionsthesis.cls), this repository contains [a PDF version of my Master's thesis](https://github.com/dionhaefner/dionsthesis/blob/master/thesis.pdf) in Physical Oceanography [and the LaTeX sources](https://github.com/dionhaefner/dionsthesis/blob/master/src) that I have used to create it.

My custom documentclass `dionsthesis.cls` is based on `uiothesis` by Eivind Uggedal (a mirror of `uiothesis` is found e.g. [here](https://github.com/dergachev/uggedal-thesis)), and is an extension of the amazing `memoir` documentclass.

Documents created with `dionsthesis` can be compiled with any modern PDFLaTeX compiler. In order to build my thesis, you will need to have Adobe's Minion Pro fonts installed. If you don't have these fonts, remove the option `minionpro` from `\documentclass{dionsthesis}`, and Linux Libertine will be used instead. If you want to compile my thesis, you will also have to install my package [pgfcache](https://github.com/dionhaefner/pgfcache) (but it is not required to create your own document with `dionsthesis`).

Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions!
